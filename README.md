# leading_1_detector
 Design a leading "1" detector circuit for 8-bit bus.
 
 Problem :- If the 8-bit bus value 00101110 then the outputshould be 0x6 since 6th bit represents the leading "1".
 Similarly, If the 8-bit bus is 00001111 then the output should be 0x4.

 Solution :- using Casex, you can Implement this circuit.
